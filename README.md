# Weather App

This is a simple Weather App I created using React.js.
It is currently deployed at [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) on this URL:

https://weather-app-mmamuric.web.app/

Here are some of the technologies I used for this app:
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management. Probably an overkill for such a small app like this, but I wanted to get more hands-on practice in using it.
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) to easily create React UI components.
- [Weather API](http://www.weatherapi.com/) to fetch weather data. Currently on the Free Plan, which should suffice.
- [Weather Icons React](https://najens.github.io/weather-icons-react/) to display those cool-looking weather-related icons.
